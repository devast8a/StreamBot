This is an IRC bot that tracks online streams you give it working on several services including Own3d.tv and Twitch.tv.

To see example config files which you need to create and put in the same folder as the executable, see 'Examples' folder.

Some of the command answers are hardcoded and you need to change those yourself.

For this to run you need the following libraries:

 - HtmlAgilityPack (http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com)
 - SmartIrc4net (http://www.meebey.net/projects/smartirc4net)
